==================================

Using shortcuts for zooming doesn't work in the 2D editor because `EditorZoomWidget`, the corresponding shortcut context node of `zoom_minus`, `zoom_reset`, and `zoom_plus` buttons, doesn't get focused in the editor. As the result, the widget doesn't react to shortcuts anywhere it's used.

Perhaps, setting the shortcut context of `EditorZoomWidget` buttons to some other node could solve this problem
